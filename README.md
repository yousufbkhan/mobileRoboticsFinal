This repository contains the code from the main PC for EECE5550: Mobile Robotics Final Project. The group members of this team are Yousuf Khan, Farhan Sarfraz, and shane Treadway.

The repository itself with the non-zip files were used to run the AprilTag Detection on the TurtleBot as described in the paper.

The two .zip files are used to run the simulation code that was described in the paper.
